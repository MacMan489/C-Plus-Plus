Write a C++ program to calculate the average grades of 20 students in a class. Each student takes 5 exams and the average grade is calculated as the average of all the 5 exams. The program must ask the user to input grades for each student, calculate the average grade and display the output. Write a function and integrate it with the main program.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<iostream.h>
float gradesOfstudents(int a[20]); //function declaration
main()
{
clrscr();
int grades[20];
float avg = 0.0;
cout<<"Enter grades of twenty students "<<endl;
for(int i=0;i<20;i++) //reading 20 values into grades array
{
   cin>>grades[i];
}
avg = gradesOfstudents(grades); //calling function gradesOfstudents(a[]) with passing an array
cout<<"Average grade of twenty students is : "<<avg<<endl;
getch();
return 0;
}

float gradesOfstudents(int a[20]) //function definition
{
   float avg=0,sum=0;
   for(int i=0;i<20;i++)
   { //calculating array average
   sum = sum + a[i];
   }
   avg = sum/i;
   return avg; //returning average
}
